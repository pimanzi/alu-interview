# ALU-Interview: Minimum Operations

This repository contains the solution to the following problem:

## Problem Statement

In a text file, there is a single character "H". Your text editor can execute only two operations in this file: Copy All and Paste. Given a number n, write a method that calculates the fewest number of operations needed to result in exactly n "H" characters in the file.

## Function Prototype

```
def minOperations(n)

```

### Function Description

1.Parameters: n (integer) - The desired number of "H" characters.

2. Returns: An integer representing the fewest number of operations needed to achieve exactly n "H" characters. If it is impossible to achieve n characters, return 0

### Solution overview

The solution leverages the mathematical concept of factorization to determine the minimum number of operations. The key insight is to break down n into its prime factors and use these factors to simulate the sequence of "Copy All" and "Paste" operations efficiently.

## Approach

1. Initialization: Start with a single "H" in the file.

2. Factorization: Decompose n into its prime factors.

3. Operations Counting: For each prime factor, simulate the required "Copy All" and "Paste" operations.
